First arrange your data to a format spacy can read and create the model:
	we used Demo Train NER script we created with
		some stuff we wanted to train.

Download base_config using the website and the specifications
	of what we want to train:
		https://spacy.io/usage/training#config

With the base config file open this file and edit:
		train = null
		dev = null
	to something you will use for example:
		train = "./marvelNER_train.spacy"
		dev = "./marvelNER_valid.spacy"

After that run the following command to compile the config file
	into a format spacy uses:
python -m spacy init fill-config base_config.cfg config.cfg

Now that we have the config file ready we just need to run 
	the following command to start training the data:
python -m spacy train config.cfg --output ./marvelNERModel

After that you can use the model like any other spacy model
